# Todo List App


## Overview

Welcome to the Todo List App! This is a simple yet powerful application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, showcasing my skills as a frontend developer. The app allows users to manage their tasks seamlessly by adding, editing, deleting, and marking them as completed. Users can categorize tasks as finished, pending, or view all tasks for better organization and management.


## Features

- **Add Task**: Easily add a new task to the list by typing it into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Edit Task**: Edit an existing task on-the-fly by clicking the "Edit" button, modifying the text, and saving the changes.
- **Delete Task**: Remove unwanted tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Stay organized by marking tasks as completed with the "Finished" button, and undo the action if needed.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks based on their status (All, Pending, or Finished) using the intuitive filter buttons.
- **Error Handling**: Receive instant feedback with error messages displayed using React Toastify when attempting to add an empty task.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, thanks to the app's fully responsive design.
